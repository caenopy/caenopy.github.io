    <p>Hi! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford.</p>
    <p>These days, I'm focused on applications of AI and machine learning in audio and computer graphics. I'm currently seeking ML and software engineering roles for summer 2023.</p>
    <p>I was also an undergraduate at Stanford in the Physics and Philosophy departments, where I focused on understanding how large systems of neural networks collectively perform computations that underlie behavior. I spent two summers in the Computation in Distributed Recurrent Systems (Druckmann) Lab and part of a gap year in the Neural Dynamics and Computation Lab.</p>
    <p>I'm in the process of making this site a unified repository of my work.</p>
    <p>For now, you can reach me by email at npbecker [at] stanford [dot] edu.</p>
